            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But howe impudent ſo euer the fleſh is, it feareth neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, where as nothing is to be feared.

But whileſt theſe foliſhe men do auoyde one vice, they runne into the contrary. The Iewes hoped that if Chriſte were rid out of the way that then the people wuld forſake him, but after the deth of Chriſt many more beleued &amp; came vnto Chriſte, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:6975:9"/> there did before, when as in one daye manye thouſandes receaued the faithe. They feared leſt if Chriſt liued the Romanes would haue taken away their countrey and nation, which hapned vnto them 40. yeares after. So God derideth the counſels of the vngodly, &amp; bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to paſſe that they are ſnared and take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their owne counſels. And the ſelfe ſame thing in our dayes, doth the Pope, the Cardinals, the Biſhoppes, the Monkes, and euill ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, but they hide their counſels, yea they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne them with the title of honeſty &amp; religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>

            <p>THe Euangeliſt Iohn reherſeth by occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what moued Iudas to betray Chriſt,

Wherfore this moſt couetous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wuld ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this loſſe an other way. He deſcribeth ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the Supper whiche was prepared for Chriſt in the houſe of one Simo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and beſides that, he declareth the thinges that were done there. If any man thinke it good, he may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne that hiſtory vnto ours, we ſtudieng to be briefe haue onely taken but a few neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye thinges. Mathew who alſo by the way maketh mention of this cauſe, ſaieth that the diſciples did murmure, which ſeemeth to bee ſpoken by the figure called Synecdoche, for Iohn ſaith by expreſſe wordes, that Iudas was angry, and that he alledgeth the care of the poore, to bee the cauſe of his anger when in dede he nothing cared for the poore, but lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre and gayne moued him, for he was a thiefe and bare the bagge, he couereth his couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with a ſhew of liberality and mercy.

Their myndes were now readye on euery ſide to the matter they wente aboute, beyng moued thereto by enuy, and couetuouſneſſe of gayne.

            <p>NOthing is done here by chance, nothing is done raſhly all things are foreſene and ordained by the prouidence of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning. All thinges are gouerned by his counſell and will. Theſe thinges are ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Euangeliſt, that we might vnderſtand, that Chriſt was not compelled to die by violence or of neceſſitie, but of his own free will and by the wyll of the father, and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that all the ſhadowes of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vaniſhed away in Chriſt, it is declared alſo that Chriſt is that Lambe which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured in the old Teſtament, as Paule tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth in the <hi>1.

            <p>JT is exactely deſcribed of all the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtes, how Chriſt did inſtitute the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his body &amp; bloud after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> figuratiue ſupper y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might declare, that the figures of the old teſtament were accompliſhed and finiſhed in him, and that all thinges were renewed, that they mighte haue in memory his wonderfull great benefit geuen them in the croſſe, no leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the old fathers had in eating of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that the newe might be agreable to the olde, and that light might ſuccede darkeneſſe. He ſheweth firſt with how great a deſyre he did eate this ſupper with them, namely wyth a vehement and a moſt feruent deſire: for this figuratiue ſpeache in Hebrew is, I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, or in deſiring, that is, I haue deſired w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a wonderful &amp; great deſire to eate this Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that is, this memoriall Lambe, and I haue no leſſe deſired to eat with you this new ſupper, in the which I comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnto you the memory of my deth to be celebrated of you for euer. For as often (as Paule expoundeth) as ye ſhall eate of this breade, and alſo drinke of this wyne, you ſhalbe myndfull of my death.

I do ſo muche eſteme you, that I am redy to redeme you by my death, from euerlaſting death. I do ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſignes of this benefite and of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, whiche being eaten of you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the memory of me, vnto the which ſigns I gaue the names of my body, and bloud, that they might the more ſtrongly moue your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. My deathe is your lyfe, if ſo be that you beleue that by my death I haue appeaſed god for you, and that my bloud hath waſhed away your ſinnes, this ſhall noriſhe and fatten you inwardly. This beyng weighed with a true faith, ſhall make mery and pacify your myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. Take therfore and eate, do this in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of me, I go now from you, ſo that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> henceforth I ſhall not eate and drynke wyth you after the accuſtomed maner. I ſhall with my bloud being ſhed confirme that teſtament which ſomtyme I eſtabliſhed with Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but after a new ſorte, not by the bloud of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes as it was in the olde tyme, but by myne owne bloud. Neither ſhal my couenaunt ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with the Iewes only, but with al mankind. This worde braunche or fruite of the vine, is a paraphraſes of wyne, and doth ſignifye not onely that to be wyne which Chriſt dranke in the cuppe and gaue vnto his diſciples, but it alſo declareth, that it was bloud, but ſuch as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:6975:15"/> came out of the vine, and not powred out of his body, as if a man would ſay: this is of the fruite of wheat, he ſhoulde by circumloqution ſignifie bread, and therwithall declareth, that it is not onely bread, but alſo it is bread made of wheat and of no other graine. For there is alſo bread made of Rye and of Otes. &amp;c. And this emphaſis haue all parephraſes, and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Hebrew parephraſes. So whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt calleth himſelfe the ſonne of man. Therfore he ſaith, henceforth I wil no more eat nor drink (wherfore it is likely, Chriſt him ſelf alſo dyd eate and drinke) namely after this ſort, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an other ſort and newe, that is to ſay after my reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; I wil the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eat with you whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as you ſhall eate with me at my table in the kingdom of my father, but not after that ſort as bodies are wonte to be fed, but in the ſtate of immortalitie. Therfore the kingdom of god is either the time after the reſurrection or els a more full knowledge of Chriſt,<note place="margin">The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God</note> or els the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life after this life, in the which the faith full ſhall eate and drinke vppon the table of Chriſt wiih Chriſt that moſt ſwete drinke of immortalitie as appeareth in the .xxii. chapi. Luke. As concerning the ſence of theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Chriſt, this is my body and of the foode of the ſoule, we haue ſpoken inoughe of, in an other place. Let vs not diſpute how the bread is made the bodye of Chriſte, but lette vs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remember the benefitte performed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs by the bodye of Chriſte, that being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſatiated in our minds we may lift our
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:6975:15"/> hartes to him which ſitteth at the right hand, of the father, that is in a certain limited place in heauen, that we may loue one another, that we may liue innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, that we may geue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes vnto the Lord, and walk worthely in our vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. To eate of the body of Chriſt is none other thing, but to beeleue that his body was geuen to the death, to make ſatiſfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our ſinnes. To drinke the bloud of Chriſte, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but to beleue that Chriſt his bloud was ſhed for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waſhing away of our ſins: nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther is there any other eating of the bodye of Chriſt, then that which is done by faith, of the which Chriſt ſpeaketh in the <hi>6.</hi> chap of Iohn neither can it be done of any but of the godly. But the eating of the ſimbolical and miſtical bread, is common both to the godly and alſo to the vngodly, althoughe after a diuers ſorte. For there be ſome which do eate the bread of the ſupper vnworthely, and drinke the wine vnworthely, and by that meanes do get vnto themſelues death and iudgement, that is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And thoſe although they eat &amp; drink with their mouth the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the body &amp; bloud of the Lord, yet neuertheleſſe, they eate not the body of Chriſt, neither do they drinke his bloud, vnleſſe they will make Chriſt a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar (which farre be it from the euerlaſting and infallible truth) whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he ſaith. They which eate my fleſhe and drinke my bloud, abyde in me and I in them. There is none (I thinke) that will affirme if he haue his right wittes, that this agreeth with the vngodlye, but as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:6975:16"/> for the godly, they do not onely eat with their teath the ſignes, neither haue they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>are ſigns but beſides the eating of the ſignes whiche is done with the mouth of the body, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly fed in their mindes with the body and bloud of Chriſt by the eating of faith, which faith the ſpirit of Chriſt kindleth within the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, at ſuch tyme &amp; as much, &amp; to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it pleaſeth him. For the operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his ſpirit is not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the ſignes, neither is grace ſo put in them, that it ſhuld be brought vnto them as it were in a wagon, but Chriſt that chief and eternall biſhop doth feede the faithfull with his body and bloud, the miniſter only adminiſtring the ſacraments outwardly, vnto whome he ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth before their eyes, putteth in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and declareth the grace of god, he bringeth it not to them he geueth it not, neither doth he diſtribute it to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therfore a faithful mind doth receaue the body and bloud, and hauing receaued it, the ſpirite of God doth with heat diſgeſt it, &amp; poureth it into the inwarde bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the ſoule, of the which ſpringeth a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous and inwarde refreſhing vnto a godly mynde, when we celebrate therfore the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord or thankes geuing, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that only ſacrifice which was offred vppon the croſſe with thankes geuyng.

And to the chriſtians to die, is no other thing, than to leaue the world and to goe vnto God, whereas otherwyſe if we ſhuld die without Chriſt, deth were the moſt terribleſt thing that could be vnto all fleſhe. The Euangeliſt therefore by theſe wordes doth make death pleaſant and acceptable, and doth declare what death &amp; alſo what the pain of ſin is made vnto vs by the death of Chriſt, namely the end of all euils and the beginning of a new and euerlaſting life.

Agayne the more we come and addicte our ſelues vnto the worlde, the more we departe from God, betwene theſe two there is no meane, neither maieſt thou cleaue to both of them, but in that the Euangeliſt doth ſay that the diuel did put this treaſon into the hart of Iudas, he doth it to declare that theſe wicked deedes and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes are done by the diuel, as of the author of them, that is to ſay by his inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.

So that which is created good in vs of God, the deuill draweth to our deſtruction. He put of his garments. &amp;c. It is a kind of ſpeaking, which deſcribeth the thing manifeſtlye, and as it were ſetteth it beefore our eyes.</p>

For when they take armour and dryue away the enemy and punniſhe the euill, they ſerue alſo Chriſt with their ſworde, when as neuertheleſſe they are ſomewhat defiled, and haue ſome thing common with the buſines of the world, ſo that they cannot be wholly with out dregges, and be alwayes bent to heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinges. But for you which are the lighte
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:6975:23"/> of the world, being lightened of me which am the true light, a greater integritie is mete, &amp; a greater pureneſſe, ye muſt ſhine aboue other in the light of faith and charitie, not in worde only but in example of life, let not your hartes haue a regard to earthly thinges, but beyng purged from the contagiouſneſſe of al earthly dregges, let them be caried vpward as it wer like fyre vnto heauenly thinges. Be ye ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore far from ambition, from the deſire of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all thoſe things which may wrap your mindes in earthly thinges. Se that you ſeke not gredily for glory &amp; rule in the world, for I haue preferred you to the kingdome of heauen, that is to the preachyng of grace, and truth. Be ye not therfore bent to other things which might withdraw you from your office, let other men ſeke to be lordes, haue ye onely a care to ſerue others, that ſhall extoll you to the eternall ioy, and ſhall make you mightye in dede. Looke vppon me whiche came not to rule or to be greate, but I am rather conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt you miniſtring vnto you as a moſt abiect ſeruant, and waſhing your feete, I haue lefte heauen and deſcended vnto you, takyng vpon me for your ſakes all pouerty &amp; affliction, why ſhould you then be aſhamed to ſerue others for my ſake? It is a ſmal matter that ye haue abiden with me hitherto, &amp; that ye haue cleaued vnto me, which neuertheleſſe was not of your owne power, for ye haue not elected me, but I deſcending from my fathers ſeat haue called and choſen you, what good ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer

For it is not ſufficient, that ye haue abiden w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> me hitherto after a ſorte, for they were but ſkirmiſhes, &amp; ſleight battails, but now there be greater troubles at hand. The time is now preſent that Sathan turneth al his force and all hys armour againſt me and you. Ye know that ye wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted nothing, when I ſent you w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

For thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which are written of me muſt needes be performed, and go ye forwarde without feare in preaching of the truth, I will neuer be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from you, as I haue before defended you. I will prouide for you, and miniſter vnto you all ſuch thinges as ye wante. By theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the lorde plucketh out of the hartes of the diſciples, the affection of the fleſh, wherewyth they were touched, and alſo he prepareth and encourageth them to battayles whiche were to come. For they ſhould ſuffer greater thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges after his departure, when as they ſhould

But in that he ſayeth, let him ſell his coate &amp; bye a ſworde, it is a phraſe of ſpeache, by the which is ſignified a moſt great daunger to be at hand, as though Chriſt would ſay. If they rage ſo againſt me, they will not ſpare you, be ye therfore ſtronge and conſtante, for they ſhall ſo ſpoyle and kill you, that it ſhall ſeeme that ye haue nede of ſwordes, &amp; yet he biddeth not them to fight with the ſword, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo diligently had forbidden them that they ſhould not reſiſt euell, and to turne the other cheke to him which would geue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a blowe, yea and afterward he biddeth Peter (ſtriking Malchus) to put vp his ſword, neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Papiſts proue by this an eccleſiaſtical ſword and a prophane ſword.

The men which followe the Apoſtels haue no neede of ſwordes, but if they ſhall diligently continue in preachyng of the truth, thei ſhal ſtir vp the ſwordes of al the wicked ones agaynſt them, whom they ſhall agayne reſiſt with the ſword

So plaieth our fleſhe, when it is lefte to it ſelfe. No man acknowledgeth his errour, no man wil beleue him which admoniſheth him.

Moreouer this moſt wicked varietie
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6975:27"/> dareth thruſt himſelf into the holy fellowſhip and table of the lorde, not fearyng to lye vnto him which knoweth all thinges.

So in lyke maner dare we ſom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>times com to the holy communion with Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das boaſting our ſelues to be godly, when as inwardly we be moſt vngodly. And althoughe both Peter and Iudas fell either of them, yet great is the diuerſitie betwene the deniall of Peter, and the betrayeng of Iudas. Peter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouerwhelmed with a ſodayne terror ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of feare and cowardneſſe of mynde, but Iudas ſinned of a pretenſed malice, for the deuell had poſſeſſed his harte, Chriſt therfore ſaith that Peters faithe was not altogether gone, for althoughe he denied him outwardly with his mouth, yet neuertheleſſe his hearte fell not from Chriſt, and god ſuffreth the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſometymes to ſlippe, that they may knowe themſelues more throughly, and humble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in mind, learne and acknowledge their infirmitie, and after their fall they may riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne more ſtrong and better couraged. Thei may learn to put no confidence in themſelues, to be ſory for other mens falles, and to be more carefull, and for that cauſe Chriſt ſaieth, and thou after thou art conuerted ſtrengthen thy brethern. Sathan ſo ſtirred vp Iudas, as we haue heard before, that not onely he ſhroncke from Chriſt, but beſydes that he betraied him to his enemies to be deſtroied, &amp; here it is ſaid that the diuell entred into him, after the ſop,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6975:28"/> which is thus to be vnderſtanded, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell which before had poſſeſſed him, did now more fully poſſeſſe him, and more vrge him to bring to paſſe the miſchiefe which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. For euen as in faithe there are certain degrees, ſo alſo is there in infidelitie &amp; breach of faith. No man is made moſt good vpon the ſodayne, ſo no man is moſte wicked ſodenly, by littell and littell we ſlide into the pitfall, if we watche not, if we reſiſt not the beginning and if we neglecte ſmall matters. Our foote muſte be plucked by and by out of the clay of ſynnes, leaſt it faſten more depely in, we muſt ſtreight way reſiſt the affections, leaſt they come to haue dominion ouer vs. Sathan ſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth not, he neuer ceaſeth, but walketh about like a roaring Lyon, ſeeking where to get his pray, whom let vs reſiſte by faith, and he wil flye from vs. The lord is ſtrong to deliuer vs out of the mouth of the Lyon, ſo that we flye vnto him by and by with our whole hart, and caſt our ſelues all wholy vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him with a ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d faith, let vs take hede of the meate and of the baite which that moſte ſubtill enemye layeth for vs, leſt when we haue deuoured it, we fal with Iudas into the euerlaſting night.</p>
            <q>¶And when he was gone Ieſus ſaid, now is the ſonne of man glorifyed, and God is glorified by hym, and God ſhall glorify hym by hym ſelf, and ſhal glorify him by and by. My

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:6975:29"/> of gods prouidence. The time is now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that the ſonne of man ſhalbe made noble after a new ſort y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſay, by his deth, croſſe, reſurrection, and aſcenſion, and other thinges which folowed after the ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit, as miracles and the conuerſion of the Gentiles. &amp;c. For that cauſe ſaith Paule in his Epiſtle to the Romanes, that the ſon of God, whiche was borne of the ſeede of Dauid as touching the fleſh, was declared to be the ſonne of God with power, as concernyng the ſpirite of ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, in that he roſe again from the dead. And this power of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of the which Chriſt alſo ſpeaketh here, ſhuld follow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in few daies after, which was not done by an aungell, or by any creature, but by the power of the father, as Paule witneſſeth in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of the Coloſſians, where he ſaieth. Who hath raiſed him vp. &amp;c. Chriſt therfore ſayeth and God ſhall glorifye hym. He alſo by theſe wordes comforteth the harts of his diſciples who were not a little troubled now, bicauſe he had made mention vnto them of his death, as though he woulde ſay. The tyme is come that I ſhall accompliſh the will of my father that is, that I ſhall dye, but by this my death my father ſhalbe glorified. Be ye not therfore troubled, ye ſhall ſee and that by and by what great glory my father will geue me. By theſe wordes we be taught not to be ſorye, if anye troubles com vnto vs by the vngodly, for the croſſe &amp; alſo death get vnto the godlye moſte great glory, when as nothyng can chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:6975:29"/> the godlye, whiche is not ordeined by the good will of the father, and whiche ſhall not bryng vnto them wonderfull greate glory. Furthermore the glory of God commeth by thoſe thinges which we ſuffer for his names ſake, and what is he that would not wiſhe to haue the glory of God ſet forth, yea eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with his owne hurt and danger? And when as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites do go away from the fellowſhippe of the faithfull, then is the church deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a moſt great euill, ſo that the faithfull which deſire to haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of god ſet forth, may wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thely reioice. And for bicauſe that Chriſt had foretold that ſuch great euils ſhuld come vnto his diſciples, and had ſhewed them the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which they ſhould be in by the means of falſ brethren, of whom Iudas went before as a figure of them, nowe in the meane tyme he comforteth and encourageth them, leaſt they ſhoulde bee fainte harted, and diſcouraged, teaching them, by what meanes, they mighte ſtand ſtedfaſt, and to be ſafe againſte all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, which were at hand, namely by concord and mutual loue amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g themſelues, as though he would ſay.

In the meane tyme we muſt mark the loue of God, which doth not altogether reiect vs, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of oure infirmitie, but taketh in good worthe our foliſhnes, and turneth it to good, we haue of purpoſe left out that which Iohn writeth from the xiiii. chap. to the xviii. leaſt our booke and thoſe thinges whiche we haue expounded in Iohn ſhould encreaſe to a great volume.

            <q>¶When Ieſus had ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe words he went out according to his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed maner with his diſciples o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the brooke Ceder, that is to ſay into the Mounte Olyuete, where was a gardein into the which he en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tred, and his diſciples alſo and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das alſo which betrayed him knew the place, bicauſe Ieſus had often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reſorted thither with his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and when he came vnto the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:6975:30"/> place which is called Gethſeman he ſaid vnto them, ſit ye here, tyll I go aſyde and pray, and he toke Peter &amp; Iames and Iohn with him, and he began to be afraide and to be vexed &amp; he ſaid vnto them my ſoule is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull euen vnto the death abyde ye here and watche with me, praye that ye enter not into temptation, and being gone forward a litel, and departed from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> almoſt a ſtones caſt, he fel vpon the earth and being proſtrate kneling vpon his knees, he prayed, ſaying, Abba father, all thynges are poſſible vnto thee, yf it be poſſible take away this cup fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, neuertheleſſe not my wyll, but thy will be done.</q>
            <p>CHriſt had armed his diſciples againſt the perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which were to come, and had taught them, wyth what ſwordes they ſhould reſiſt them, that is to ſay, by the know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lege of both the teſtamentes, and by the ſword of the ſpirite which is the worde of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng a two edged ſword and cuttyng on either ſyde, and percyng euen into the inwarde par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, furthermore he had admoniſhed them not to put any diſtruſt of hys care and goodneſſe,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:6975:31"/> for that hauing him for their defence and ſaue garde they ſhoulde bee euen as ſafe as they had bene alwayes beefore. For althoughe he ſhould go from them as concernyng the body, yet for all that he would not forſake them, but be preſent with them in his ſpirite euen vnto the ende of the worlde. Moreouer he woulde pluck out of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, with the which nature is defiled, to the intente they mighte wholly depend of him, renouncing the world, and applieng themſelues to heauenly things. Now he ſetteth forth an example in himſelfe, with what mynde, and with what conſtancy all the godly ſhould receaue the croſſe, he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth againſt death that he might declare, that he died not againſt his will, but willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, and of loue, not diſſembling in the meane tyme his infirmitye and feare, leſt we ſhould diſpair if at any tyme our fleſh ſhould be made afrayde with temptations and daungers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant men ſome feare of the fleſh, but the feare of God which is in them, and their faythe to God, ſhaketh of and ouercommeth the fear of the fleſh. This we ſee manifeſtly in Chriſte, who as he toke vppon him for our ſakes, the infirmitie of the fleſh, beeyng made like vnto his brethren in all thinges, ſo alſo he was not aſhamed to confeſſe his feare and ſorrowe to his diſciples. That we might haue wherwith

He was ſory for vs, he prayeth vnto the father for vs, that we mighte learne by hym, what we ſhuld do in dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, and to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhould flye vnto, he declareth hymſelfe to bee man in dede, which is touched with the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng of deth, neuertheleſſe in the mean tyme, he conſecrateth himſelfe wholy to the wyll of the father, vnto whoſe will he ſubmitted hys owne will.

Put vp therfore the ſword in his place. For all that take the ſworde ſhal periſh with the ſword.

            <p>THe fleſh is wonte in aduerſitie not to ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto God, but to his own weapons, and this doth Chriſt reprehende in Peter, as though he would ſaye, we muſt not fighte now with weapons, but with ſufferaunce and mekenes. It is no time now to ſtrike the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſworde, but to obey the wil of God. If I haue nede of weapons &amp; armies of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, I coulde ſodenly haue of my father a great and infinite number of ſouldiors redy to helpe me. I am not alſo here, neither came I hither, to the intent I ſhoulde fight with the ſword, but that I mighte redeme you by my death, and leaue with you an example of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

            <q>¶The ſame houre ſayde Ieſus to the multitude, and to them which came vnto him, from the high prieſts and magiſtrate of the temple and elders ye be come out as it were agaynſte a thiefe, with ſwordes and clubbes, to take me. I ſate daily teaching in the temple amongeſt you, &amp; ye toke me not, but this is your howre and the power of darkneſſe, but all this is done, that the Scriptures of the prophets myght be fulfilled. Then al his diſciples forſoke him and fled and there followed hym a certaine young man, clothed in linnen vpon his bare bodye, and the young men caughte him, but he lefte his linnen cloth, and fled from them naked.</q>
            <p>CHriſt as he is redye to ſuffer all thynges which theſe men deuiſed to work againſt him ſo alſo he ceaſeth not to reuoke them from their malice which they hadde taken in hande, neither doth he allow their entent, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

So oughte we to ſuffer the inuaſions of the wycked, and that wyth greate mildnes of mind, and patience, neither muſt we reuenge our ſelues with our owne hand. But in the meane tyme muſt ſo ſet bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of the wicked their miſcheuous doings, that they may vnderſtand how much they ſynne againſte God and vs, to ſee yf we can by any meanes reuoke them from theyr conceiued malice, and win them to the lord, or at the leaſte to take from them all occaſion wherby they might excuſe their ſynnes.</p>
            <q>¶Then the band and the capitain, and the officers of the Iewes toke Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus and bound him and led hym a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to Annas firſte, for he was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law to Caiphas which was
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:6975:40"/> the high prieſte the ſame yeare, and Caiphas was he that gaue counſell to the Iewes, that it was expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that one man ſhould die for the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple, and Annas ſente hym bound to Cayphas the high prieſt. They ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore takyng Ieſus led him to Cay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas the hyghe prieſte, where the Scribes, the chiefe prieſtes and the elders had aſſembled together.</q>
            <p>LVke the Euangeliſt ſayeth, they led him and brought him, and this ſemeth to bee ſpoken not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out an emphaſis as though he would ſay. They led him which had healed all men, and which contayned and led al thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges who if he had not led them, they had all periſhed. Luke &amp; the other leaue out the houſe of Anna, of the which Iohn maketh mention very aptly, howbeit there is nothyng left out of the Ea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ngeliſts, that pertayneth to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the hiſtory, and it ſemeth that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining of Chriſt concerning his diſciples &amp; his doctrine, was done in the houſe of Cay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas, and not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe of Anna. For in that he is led to Anna, it was done bicauſe it was in their way as they we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and to honour An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na withall. But examining of his doctrine &amp; diſciples belonged to Caiphas who was the high prieſt for that yeare. Therfore Anna ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him by and by away to Caiphas his ſon in law, which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was in office. And I iudge that al the denials of Peter were done in the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:6975:40"/> court of the biſhop which may eaſily be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red if they be weighed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order of the hiſtory of Iohn &amp; others. Iohn maketh mention by the way of Anna, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> returneth to Caiphas which if it be not marked, it might ſeme that al theſe thinges wer done in the houſe of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, which neuertheleſſe the other three men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion to be done in Caiphas houſe (&amp; Cayphas was he) It is a digreſſion to the deſcription of the perſon. Caiphas counſell, whiche is more manifeſtly ſet forth in the xi. of Iohn, is ſo put forth of him, as though it ſhould be healthfull to the common wealth, when as he entended nothing but to put Chriſt to deth. In that he ſpake the truth, it was of the holy ghoſt, but he ſpake this of guile and malice, for the ranc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kor of his harte made him to ſpeak thoſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. In the mean while he adourneth his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, and pretendeth the common welth to hide his deceit, and he vſeth the words which wer like himſelf. The prieſtes ſaw their authority to diminiſhe daily, and that very manye claue vnto Chriſt, &amp; therfore they feared their own things, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which cauſe Caiphas vſeth this argument, by the which he might chiefly ſtir vp their harts. Why ſtay ye, ſayth he? doe ye not ſee our aucthoritie decayeth, and that by this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Yf ye wil haue your own ſtate to be in ſafety, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away, ye be ſlouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and lingerers, which ſhall turn at length to your owne diſpleaſure. &amp;c. Wherfore he is the firſte authour of Chriſtes deathe, and he encourageth the reſt, to the conceiued miſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:6975:41"/> acte, his houſe therefore was a fit place for the vngodly ones to take cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel together. Let vs apply theſe thinges to our tymes and let vs learne to diſcerne betwene a good citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen and a faithfull ſenator, and betwene a trai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tor and a falſe man. They which haue trayto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous mindes doe alwayes pretende in their counſels the health of the common wealthe, when as they goe aboute the deſtruction of all good men, and into their houſes do the owles flye vnto, where they dare ſpeake free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye. Suche metinges, aſſemblies and conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies in cities, are moſt certain cauſes of the diſtruction of a common wealth, which euery man may moſt eaſily perceiue, thoughe he be meanely ſkilled in hiſtories, and if ſo be that ye O magiſtrates are ignoraunt of theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges, then be ye very vnſkilfull, and ye haue ſmall experience of thynges, but if ſo bee that ye do know thoſe thynges, and do not beware of them. nor puniſhe the authors, then are ye to vniuſte, wycked, and enemies to your cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and in that we do ſo crye againſt thoſe, we do it not to this end onely, that ye ſhould puniſh them (which I feare me is in vayne) but bicauſe it is our dutye ſo to do, and for ſo muche as we aſſuredly forſee, that ſuche men wil be the deſtruction of the common wealth. it is therefore nedefull to admoniſhe you of them.

            <q>¶And Peter followed him a farre of

But Peter ſtode with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out at the dore. Then went out the other diſciple which was knowen to the high prieſte, and ſpake to her that kept the dore, and broughte in Peter, and when Peter was come in, he ſate downe with the officers to ſee the ende, and when they had made a fire in the middeſt of the hal, and were ſet down together. Peter alſo ſate downe amongeſt them, &amp; warmed him at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fire, &amp; the ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and officers ſtode there, whiche had made a fire of coales, for it was cold, and they warmed themſelues and Peter alſo ſtode amongeſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and warmed himſelfe, whom when a certayne maide of the high prieſte which kept the gate, ſaw ſittyng by the fyre, and lookyng earneſtly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, ſayde. waſt not thou alſo with Ieſus of Galiley?

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:6975:42"/> do I know what thou ſayeſt, &amp; he went forth into the porch, and the cocke crewe. Then an other mayde ſaw hym, and ſayd vnto them which were there. This ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo was with Ieſus of Nazareth, and he denyed it againe with an othe ſaying? I know not the man, and aboute the ſpace of an houre after, other whiche ſtoode therby ſawe him, &amp; ſayd, verely thou alſo arte one of them, for thou arte of Galiley, and thy ſpeach alſo bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee.

               </gap>iſe, thou ſhalt denye me thriſe, and Peter went forth and wepte bitterly,</q>
            <p>Here doe we learne mans inconſtancye and mutabilitie, but the Lord doth leaue thys in vs
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:6975:42"/> leaſt we ſhoulde preſumptuouſlye clayme any thyng to our ſelues, and that we myght ryſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne after our fall, more cherefull and wary, and to learne thereby to depende wholye vpon God, &amp; put no confidence in our owne ſtrength theſe examples are to thys ende ſet forth, that we eyther ſtanding ſhoulde be afrayde and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of a fall, or ells that after we haue fallen, we ſhoulde not diſpayre, but retourning with Peter ſhould bewayle our ſinnes. The Lorde knoweth howe to vſe the fallings of his to his owne glorye. If we haue ſinned with Peter, let vs repent with Peter, and wepe bitterlye. For the elect being admoniſhed after they haue fallen, they doe aryſe agayne, they boaſte not in their ſinnes. they reioyce not when they haue done euell, and diſpyſe not Gods admonition. In that Chriſt loketh vpon Peter in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of his ſinnes, it teacheth vs, that God doth not forget hys, but admoniſheth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in &amp; without. Let vs marke the degrees which are in ſinnes, and how Peter falleth from one deniall into an other, and doth alwaies drowne him ſelf more depely in. It is a goodly matter to haue no felowſhip with vngodly and wicked men, Let vs with ſpede plucke backe our foote if we chaunce to fal in company with ſuch men let vs withſtande the beginninges, neyther let vs cleaue to the company of ſinners. For if we do abide with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. then can we not doe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute wonderfull great hinderaunce of oure ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and innocencye: Peter partely holdeth
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:6975:43" rendition="simple:additions"/> his peace, and partly denieth, but not of infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, but of weakeneſſe and feare. For his faith was not altogether quenched. They be like vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to Peter whiche do knowe what is right and iuſt, &amp; yet dare not vtter it, and ſet it forth whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nede requireth. Thoſe muſt diligently weigh the wordes of Chriſt, where he ſaieth, He that ſhalbe aſhamed of me before this generation, I wil alſo be aſhamed of him, before my father And let vs vnderſtand theſe things, when the glory of god, and the healthe of our neighbour doth require it. For it may come to paſſe that ſomtimes it is better to kepe ſilence and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſemble the matter. Again, there is place where to diſſemble is to betray Chriſte with Iudas. The Scripture when it ſetteth forth vnto vs the fallinges of the ſainctes, it teacheth not to forſweare and denye, but if it happen to haue fallen of feare, it rather comforteth him, &amp; ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth hym vp to repentaunce, when as it open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declareth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boſome of gods mercy, to ſuch as ſinne greatly. Chriſt vſeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crowing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cock which is natural, not only for a ſigne of Peter hys deniall, but he alſo admonyſheth Peter by the ſame crowing to repente, we ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in thing ſo little the prouidence of God doth not ceaſe, moreouer it declareth the creatures are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes of God hys grace and power. The cocke knoweth nothyng of Peter, but is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by his own nature and doth alſo crow, but God knoweth and appoynted him for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Let vs alſo marke this that there is great differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene thoſe which ſi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of weaknes
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:6975:43"/> and feare, and thoſe whiche ſinne of a purpoſed malice. The ſinne of the weake ones is not to the death, but the ſinne of the vngodly is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted agaynſt the holy ghoſt, and by that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes it ſhal neuer be forgeuen. They which fal or ſlippe, yea though it bee moſte greuouſlye, yet if they being admoniſhed do ryſe vp agayne after their fal, and do vnwrap them ſelues out of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, do forſake their vngodlyneſſe, and alſo the vngodly do wept and ſhew forth ſignes of true repentaunce it is manifeſt that thoſe men are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecte and Godly, and that they ſinned of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Thei abide no longer in the filthe of ſins, but as ſoone as they come to them ſelues, they place their foote into the waye of ryghteouſnes, they runne vnto God hys mercye for forgeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and they be made more humble wary and diligent, but they which diſpiſe the admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the godly, neyther runne after thei haue fallen to the ſanctuarye of God hys grace, but reioyce and glory in their ſinnes, heapyng one miſchiefe vpon an other, neither can be reuoked by any meanes, being not onely conuerſaunt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the vngodlye and enemies of the truth, but alſo declaring them ſelues to be capitaines and Emperours agaynſt the truth, it is many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that ſuch men are vngodlye, and that they haue ſinned of a purpoſed malice, we maye ſee the examples of both kyndes of theſe ſinners, the one in Dauid and Peter, the other in Saul and Iudas.</p>

            <p>CHriſt teacheth in hys anſwere how free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye the Preacher of the woorde of God ought to ſpeake before the maieſtrate and the church, when he is aſked, and the glory of God requireth the ſame, he ſayth therefore, I haue ſpoken nothing in ſecret, that is, I haue ſayd nothyng which I would haue hidden, or that I am aſhamed of. My doctrine is of god, true and ſincere. I haue vttered the ſame ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore vnto all men, bycauſe it behoueth al men to know it, and it is healthful vnto al men. Furthermore I haue not ſought for any ſecret

By thys place we ſee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the words of Chriſt ought not to bee wreſted to any kynde of outwarde
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:6975:45" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſhewe and hipocriſie, but to the preperation of the mynde. Finally thys is a great &amp; an hygh thing to haue the mynd ſo prepared that it wil not onely ſuffer one iniurye or two but verye great iniuries, ſo that it may aduance the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye of God, and bring any commoditie to oure neyghbour. And if that happen not, it is better to preferre the leſſe iniurye before the greater. Therefore it was expedient to turne the other cheke here, when as by that meanes he ſhuld haue brought no other thyng to paſſe, but haue geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue had more iniurye done vnto hym. All things ought to be done of the beleuers to edification. And what was there to be hoped for in thys varlet? What was there to be loked for of thys moſt wicked high Byſhop? Which eyther commaundeth or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth to ſtrike one being bound and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned, contrary to all lawe and ryght, yea and that in that place, where the innocentes ſhoulde ſeeke for defence. There is therefore a place, where we ought to ſuffer paciently, and contrary there is a place where we muſt reſiſt malice and vngodlines euen to the death. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ſhal teach vs theſe thynges, and preſcribe a meaſure in al things. A faythful ſpirit know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth where to ſpare, where to ſtrike and where to reſiſte. Therfore this wicked ſeruaunt was worthy to be rebuked of Chriſt, that he might acknowledge hys wickedneſſe, and yet for all that Chriſt departed not one heare bredth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> charitie or pacience, but ſtoutlye ſuffereth the iniurye done vnto hym, being readye to ſuffer
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:6975:45"/> more greuous, Briefly al things are ſo to bee ſuffered, that the glorye of Chriſt &amp; the truth may be defended &amp; our conſtancy may appeare
<q>Now y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe prieſts, &amp; the elders &amp; the whole cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel ſought falſe witnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Ieſus to put hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to death, but they found none, yea though many falſe witneſſes came, yet fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d they none, for many barefalſe witnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but their witnes was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. but at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt came two falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſes, and ſaid, we haue heard this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay, I wil deſtroye thys temple made with hands, and within three dayes, I wyl build an other made wythout handes, and neyther yet were their witneſſes ſufficiente y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noughe. Then the chief prieſt aroſe and ſtoode amongeſt them, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Ieſus ſaying, aunſwereſt thou nothyng? What is the matter that theſe beare witneſſe againſte the? But Ieſus helde his peace, neither aunſwered he any thing. Again the high prieſt aſked hym and ſaid vnto hym. I charge thee by the lyuyng God, that thou tel vs, if thou be the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:6975:46"/> Chriſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſon of God? Ieſus ſayd vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to hym, thou haſt ſayd it, I am he. Neuertheleſſe I ſay vnto you, here after ye ſhall ſee the ſonne of man ſyttyng at the ryght hande of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and commyng in the cloudes of heauen. Then the high prieſt rente hys clothes, ſaying, he hath blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med, what haue we any more neede witneſſes? beholde nowe ye haue heard his blaſphemy, what thinke ye? and they aunſwered and ſayd, he is worthy of death &amp; the men which helde Ieſus, mocked hym and beat hym, and they ſpare in hys face, and couered his face, ſmote him on the face wyth their hands, ſaying. Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pheſye vnto vs O Chriſte who it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſmote thee? &amp; many other things rephrochfuly ſpake they againſt him</q>
            </p>
            <p>HEre were occaſiion to entreate of falſe witneſſe, but bycauſe we ſtudye to bee briefe, we doe admoniſhe iudges of thys one thyng, that they diligently remembre this that if falſe witneſſes doe aryſe vp agaynſte Chriſt, whoſe lyfe and doctrine could be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by no meanes, what we then hope for? Let
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:6975:46" rendition="simple:additions"/> them therefore obſerue equitie and not follow affections. The vngodly do wreſt the wordes of Chriſt contrary to hys meanyng, and thys ſlaunder is a parte of falſe witneſſe, when as we do eyther peruerte any mannes wordes or talke, or doe rehearſe them otherwiſe then he ſpake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or els enterpreate them otherwyſe then he ſpake or ment them Chriſt ſpake of the temple of hys bodye, and they falſly enterprete it to the materiall temple. Euen as in the olde tyme ſacrifices were done in the temple, and peace offrynges and clenſinges were done by ſacrifices, ſo is Chriſt made a ſacrifice vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the croſſe for our ſinnes, pacifying god his wrath agaynſt vs and ſanctifying vs. In that Chriſt holdeth his peace at the falſe witneſſes, it was not ſomuch, bicauſe of his meaknes, as bicauſe of his wiſedome. This example ought they to follow which are oppreſſed with falſe witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp; chiefely before ſuch a iudge as eſtemeth and geueth credite to falſe witneſſes. For then no anſweres or excuſes are any thyng worth, it ſhalbe moſte ſafegarde to kepe ſilence. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure thee that thou tell me, whether thou bee the Sonne of God? By this queſtion it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that the Iewes confeſſed and knewe ryghte well that the Meſſias ſhoulde bee the Sonne of God. But they aſke hym this capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous queſtion to the entent that they might ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uille and maliciouſly accuſe him in his anſwer, that is, that they might take and trappe hym in hys talke, that he which had made him ſelfe the Sonne of God, ſhould therfore be worthy
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:6975:47" rendition="simple:additions"/> to dye, and that according to the lawe. So do our papiſtes now of dayes extorte of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres of the word, what their opinion is of this new doctrine (as they terme it) And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they anſwere the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the truth, then are they by and by put to tormentes, but if they holde theyr peace they betraye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth. Wherfore the hipocrites do ſeke the truth to this entent, that they may perſecute it, when they knowe it, and alſo kill hym which confeſſeth it. Hereafter ye ſhal ſee, &amp;c. This is a gentil and healthfull admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as though he woulde ſaye. In dede ye ſee me now humble, and as it were the Sonne of the Carpenter, but be not offended with thys my humilitie, for nowe is the tyme of humilitie, I do not now ſhewe forth my glorye and power, but ſhortely ye ſhal ſee what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner one I am. He is gilty of death. The chiefe prieſt ſpeaketh this to his complices, whiche were lyke vnto hym ſelf namely haters of Chriſt, he hath blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed (ſayeth he) what neede we any more witneſſes? They fayne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, as though they had a care for the glory of God. when as neuertheleſſe their mindes are vngodly. &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure. So they ſay now a daies. He hath ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the holy Virgin, he hath polluted the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, therfore he is an heritike, what nede we any more witneſſes? So I ſay do they cry now of daies againſt the preachers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and for a coulour they pretend the honour of God and the holy Virgine, when as onely they excedingly hate the truth, and ſoly ſeeke for theyr owne commoditie. For it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:6975:47" rendition="simple:additions"/> that they ſhould ſpeake theſe thynges fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the heart, and ſhould thynke ſo vndoubtedly, when as God doth not confyrme a lye in the hart of man. They which ſpeake ſo do alwaies doubt and wauer, which may eaſily be ſene in Pharao, who one while ſpake one thing, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while an other thing, ſometymes denyed and ſomtimes affyrmed. One while he ſayed, who is this Lord? By &amp; by he ſayth I know the Lorde is iuſte. and that I haue ſinned and yet for al that in the meane tyme he goeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in hys miſchiefe, &amp;c. We will ſet forth thys more playnly. They which thus ſpeake, thys man hath taught that we ſhould not call <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe men I ſay are neuer certayne &amp; put out of doubt in theyr harts that we ſhould call vpon Marye, or that he ſhoulde be put to death which teacheth the contrarye, that is to ſay, that we ſhoulde worſhip one God.

They doe call Chriſt by the honorable name of a Prophet, &amp; turne it to mockage. As though they woulde ſay, All men call thee a great Prophet, or thou boaſteſt thy ſelf to be a prophet, prophecy ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnto vs, &amp;c. Let vs marke the nature of the vngodly and hipocrites which conſpire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth. Vnrighteouſneſſe accuſeth righteouſnes. Lyes oppreſſe the truth. Enuye hurteth charitie, and yet for all thys al things are ſo adorned, that they ſeme to haue a certain ſhew of iuſtice &amp; law. They preuent him with falſe witneſſes, they vrge him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> deceiptful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogations. The Iudges ar both accuſers &amp; alſo witneſſes. And they which are moſt blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous, do lay blaſphemye to an innocentes charge, that they might ſeme: to be reuengers of blaſphemye. But they do al things in vaine when as they finde not ſo much as a ſhewe of wickednes in Chriſt. Let vs follow this, that we may be ſo honeſtly conuerſaunt amongeſt menne and liue ſo innocentlye, that euen fame may be affeard to lye of vs. Now what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cruelty can there be deuiſed: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this which the ſouldiour vſe againſt Chriſt? An innocente is leaſt in the handes of moſt vile men, to vſe hym according to their owne luſte, yea they do ſharpen &amp; quicken their luſte in him, in which ſouldiours there is no godlineſſe, no compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they mocke hym, ſpitte vpon him, &amp; beate hym, neither omitte they any thing that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:6975:48" rendition="simple:additions"/> to the infamy of Chriſt, or to hys iniury. The ſame is done now a dayes by moſt cruell men, yea by no men, but rather wilde beaſtes, whiche haue put away all humanitie, whiche haue depriued them ſelues of the feling of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is to ſay, which do burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> miſerable men which are led for the truth of Chriſt, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> reproches and ſpiteful wordes, &amp; do mocke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being otherwiſe afflicted, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as neuertheles the lawes of nature forbyd that we ſhoulde burthen ſuch as are puniſhed, with more gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſpiteful words. No man excuſeth Chriſt no man pitieth him, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deliuereth hym. No man defendeth hym, No man ſpeaketh in hys cauſe, Nor no man remembreth the benefites paſte, to ſay once, he hath healed all diſeaſes, he hath fed the hungry, he hath taught the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt, he hath done good to all men. Thus ſo many and ſo great benefites done by Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt theſe moſte ingrate men were loſte, Thus cruelty and enuy had blotted al thinegs Theſe thinges are not done without the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence &amp; will of God, and yet for al that they which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitte theſe things, do ſinne moſt hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly, &amp; ſo do they alſo whiche take not heede that theſe thinges might not haue beene done. The lord permitteth ſuch cruel wicked dedes to be done ſometimes, to ſtirre vp our ſlouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes &amp; ſluggiſheneſſe, ſo that ſometimes we ſhould be wakened at ſuch enormities, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſhew forth our ſtrength and faith, yet in the meane time are we w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>oute excuſe, whiche haue geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> occaſion to the wicked by our negligence
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:6975:49"/> to go forward in their naughtines, neither are we free from ſo great blame. We ar ſo weake, ſo ſlouthful, &amp; vnfaythful that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> c co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit ſo great wicked dedes, wherby we ar moued yea not a litle. So blockiſh ar we altogether &amp; with out felinges. There are no wicked actes ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable or terrible, which can ſhake away our ſlepye ſluggiſhnes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. And ſeing that thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are at this pointe, let vs loke for nothing but the vtter punyſhment and vengeaunce of the Lord. Theſe be as certain ſignes of deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, as when the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is red in the morning, it is a ſigne that it wil rayne. The which thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges if any man ſee not then is he blind, but if he ſee them &amp; beware not of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then is he mad. We muſt withſtand the beginnings, A bough when it waxeth hard can not ſo eaſly be bowed Let vs therfore withſtand wicked actes before thei grow into an vſe, &amp; poſſeſſe al things, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine is prepared to late, when as the euils by long tarying are eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <q>¶When the morning was come, all the chiefe prieſts and Elders of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple tooke counſell agaynſt Ieſus to put hym to death. And they led him to theyr counſell, ſaying, Arte thou the Chriſt? Tel vs. And he ſayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. If I tell you, ye will not beleue. If I ſhall aſke you ye will not aunſwere me, neyther wil ye let
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:6975:49"/> me goe. Hereafter ſhall the Sonne of man ſit at the righte hande of the power of God. Then ſayed they all, Art thou the Sonne of God? And he ſayd: Ye ſay that I am. Then ſayd they what nede we any further wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? For we our ſelues haue heard it of hys owne mouth: Then aroſe the whole multitude and led hym a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye bound from Cayphas into the common Hall, and deliuered him to Pontious Pilate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſident. And it was morning, &amp; they them ſelues wente not into the common Hall, leaſt they ſhould be defyled, but that they might eate the paſſeouer.</q>
            <p>THe truth increaſeth and ſheweth forth it ſelf more bright in tribulations and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. The Iewes therefore get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel to kil Chriſt, which thing yet only they ſought for. Let them which go about to extinguiſhe Chriſt with perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; death diligently marke thys. And thus is the Chriſtian fayth planted with bloud, and alſo augmented by bloud. But wo be vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which do oppreſſe the truth, which neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe can neuer be oppreſſed. On the contrarye parte lyes and iniquities although they reigne for a time, yet ſhall they neuer be fyrme &amp; ſure:
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:6975:50"/> and who wil be affeard to perſente that which can neuer abyde? Agayne who wil be affeard to deffend hys cauſe, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer be oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? And yet for al that we are all ſlepye to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complyſhe excellent and diuine thinges, when as we may ſee that the vngodlye neyther ceaſe nor yet ſleepe being about their wicked actes, but break their night ſlepes, &amp; in the dawning of the daye returne agayne to their counſels. Their induſtry &amp; vigilancy doth put to ſhame our ſloughfulnes. If I ſhall ſay. The vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſomtymes aſke for the truth, but not for to embrace it, but for to perſecute it. So play our papiſts, they ſomtimes obiect captious queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Godlye, and when they go about to geue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their doctrine, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction ſerue, but they adiudge them by and by to the death. Chriſt vnderſtanding this, ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, what ſhuld I tel you? If ye had bcne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of the truth, ye mighte haue learned it long a go by my doctrine and miracles. Which ſeing ye haue not done, what neede I to talke any more with you? Hitherto is power geuen vnto you to rage agaynſte my humilitie, but hereafter ye ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of God.<note place="margin">What to ſit at the right of god is</note> By this Periphraſis he doth euidentlye proue hym ſelfe to bee the Sonne of God. As though he would ſay, Ye ſhall here after ſee that I am the ſonne of god.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:6975:50"/> ſonne of God. Therfore they thought in their own opinion, that Chriſt was iuſtly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, according to the law in. <hi>Deut,</hi> 13. of a falſe Prophet, but it was falſly vnderſtode &amp; inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted: For there it ſpeaketh of the Prophete which doth withdrawe men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the true God. which Chriſt did not. Ye ſaye, or, thou ſayeſt, is not a worde of doubting, but of affyrming af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Hebrewe Phraſe.</p>
            <q>¶Then when Iudas whiche betrayed hym, ſawe that he was condempned he repenting hym ſelfe, broughte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne the thyrtye pieces of ſiluer, to the chiefe Prieſtes and Elders, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I haue ſynned betraying the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocente bloude. But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke thou to it. And when he had caſte downe the ſiluer pieces in the Temple, he departed and wente and honge hym ſelf: And the chiefe Prieſtes tooke the pieces of ſiluer, &amp; ſayd, it is not lawfull for vs to put them into the threaſory, bycauſe it is the pryce of bloud. And they tooke counſel and bought with them a potters fielde for the buryall of ſtraungers. Wherefore that fielde is called the field of bloud vntil this
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:6975:51"/> day. Then was that fulfylled which was ſpoken by Ieremye the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete, ſaying. And they toke, xxx. ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer pieces, the price of hym that was valewed, whom being valewed, thei bought of the children of Iſrael, and they gaue them for the potters field, as the Lord appoynted me.</q>
            <p>IN Iudas is ſet forth a moſt horrible exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Gods iudgemente vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe whiche ſynne of purpoſed malice and vnfaythfulnes of whiche men the betrayer is a figure. God calleth al men mercifully to his grace, but they whom the deuil blindeth &amp; moueth doe deſpiſe hym which calleth them, or being allured to be in the number of the Sonnes of God, doe goe backewarde, wrapping them ſelues in ſynnes after ſuch a forte, that they can by no meanes be pulled backe agayne. Sathan doth ſo blynde them, that they can not ponder the heynouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their wickednes, vntil he haue throwne them downe hedlong into hell, and then at the length be theyr eyes opened, that they may ſee the greatnes of theyr wickednes, &amp; the ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the puniſhment, but yet in ſuch a ſorte, that in the meane tyme they can not conſider the exceding greatneſſe of Gods mercye, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they runne vnto the ſame. They are ſorye in deede, not bycauſe they haue offended the chiefe God, but bycauſe they ſee their ende prepared for them.

Let vs therfore take hede from ſhedding of innocente bloude, from coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe &amp; wilfull ſtubbernes, for they whiche are poſſeſſed with theſe miſchieuous actes are lyke vnto Iudas, and ſhall come vnto the like end that he did. To this are they driuen at the length, which woulde neuer obey the Lord ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing them. It nothing profited Iudas to be in the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the twelue, nothing to be the Diſciple of Chriſt, nothing to be partaker of the holy table, nothing alſo to haue Preached the word of truth, but for all this at the length hys hipocriſye was made manifeſt &amp; alſo pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.

            <q>And Ieſus ſtoode before the gouernor, who ſaid, what accuſation bringe ye againſt this man? They aunſwered, if he wer not an euil doer, we would not haue deliuered him vnto thee. Then ſayd Pilate vnto them: Take ye him therfore youre ſelues, and iudge him after youre owne lawe.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:6975:52"/> Then the Iews ſaid vnto him, it is not lawful for vs to put any man to deathe.

Then Pilate ſaid vnto the high prieſtes &amp; people I find no faulte in this manne. But they wexed more fierce, ſayinge, he ſtirreth the people, teching through<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out all Iudea, beginning at Galiley euen to this place.

If he had not bene an euill doer (ſay they) we would not haue deliuered hym vnto thee: Beholde with what vnſhamefaſtneſſe theſe moſte wicked men doe ſpeake, going about to ouercome the iudge by their impudent cry.

Let vs learne of oure Maiſter, that if we be at any time vniuſtlye accuſed, if we be mocked &amp; deſpiſed, we may be readye to ſuffer pacientlye all reproche for Chriſt and his truth.

Then Pilate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the common hall agayne, &amp; called Ieſus and ſayd vnto him: Art thou the King of the Iewes?

            <p>PIlate at the firſte ſheweth a certaine ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaunce of Iuſtice and equitie, for that he goeth about to deliuer an innocente, and to pluck him out of their handes, and he being an heathen man doth beare witneſſe of the inno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of Chriſt, but he is vnconſtant and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering like a rede, and he fowly goeth againſt his conſcience, being moued partly by feare, &amp; partly by gredy deſire to reygne. He ought not to haue ſuffred that he, whom he confeſſed to be innocente, ſhould be beaten of the ſouldiours, and muche leſſe to be crucified. For bycauſe, that Chriſt ſayth that hys kingdome is not of this worlde: the Anabaptiſtes abuſe thys ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and would take away Magiſtrates from amongeſt Chriſtians. But they ſhould marke that Chriſt ſpeaketh of him ſelfe, &amp; appoynteth the kingdome of the ſpirite. Chriſt came not to poſſeſſe a kingdome in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, but to ſet forth an example of humilitie and obedience. So in lyke caſe no Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought in his mind to be deſirous of a kingdome, no though he be cho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſen to gouerne others. So Chriſt was the king ouer the whole world, as he is alſo at this day, but he coueted not a kingdome, for he came not therfore but for to Preach: and yet for all that he denyed not him ſelf to be a king, but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired no kingdome but only of conſciences. So all preachers &amp; miniſters of the word ought to do. For although thei be appointed ouer king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes

Cor. 10.</note> yet ought they by no meanes to make ſuite for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as Ieremy ſaith, but thei ought to gouerne conſciences with the worde of God. So Paule ſayth, that the weapons of our warfare ar not carnal, but mighty through God to caſt downe holdes, by the which we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe the deuiſes, and euery high thyng, that is exalted againſt the knowledge of God, &amp; we leade euery thoughte captiue to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt, and we haue in a redines ven<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geaunce againſt al diſobedience. We may boaſt in this authority, whiche God hath geuen vs for edification and not for deſtruction. I came for thys intent that I might beare witneſſe to the truth: as though he would ſay, I came not to the end to reigne but to beare witneſſe to the truth. To beare witneſſe of the truth, is the Periphraſis of a Preacher.<note place="margin">To beare witnes to the truth.</note> So Iohn was ſent to beare witneſſe of the lyghte, that is of the truth.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:6975:56"/> And who ſoeuer hath but euen a crome of the truth within him, the ſame is begotten of him, &amp; heareth his voyce. Chriſt is not onely made equall with wicked perſons, but is caſt muche more lower the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wicked perſons. For the thiefe is looſed but Chriſt is killed. They geue a mur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>therer his life, but they deſyre to haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> author of lyfe crucified: they chuſe a thiefe and reiecte a Sauiour. By the whiche we are taught not only the maliciouſneſſe of the Phariſeies, but alſo the inconſtancye &amp; ingratitude of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people. It was not long before that they cried and ſange Hoſanna, and extolled him ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon the Aſſe with great prayſes, ſaying, bleſſed be he which commeth in the name of the Lord. Now they crie as faſte again, he is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauer, Let him be crucified. Let no man ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hunt for prayſe of the people. Let no man glorye, if the common people prayſe hym. The wauering and inconſtante people is by and by perſwaded vnto a contrarye ſentence, ſo he is curſed in deede that putteth his confidence in man. Pilate beareth witnes more then once of the innocencye of Chriſt, and ſaith that he doth fynde no cauſe of death in him. He is therefore vniuſte, bycauſe he ſuffreth an innocent to bee whypped. But he feared men more then God. A iuſte iudge ought not to punyſhe the giltles to get the fauour of other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

A iudge ought not to haue a reſpect to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure or diſpleaſure of men, but vnto the rule of equitie and lawe. They which be ſofte and weake, doe by litle and litle ſlippe, till at the length they declyne altogether from the ryght waye Whiche we may ſee by Pilate, who for that he doth not conſtantly proſecute y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whiche he knew to be ryght, is compelled at the length to geue ſentence agaynſt an innocent, his own conſcience accuſing him to the contrary, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>CHriſt in all his torments both of body and mynde, hath nothing to lighten his payne though it were neuer ſo litle: the Lord did thruſt hym down and drowne him in all euils, and tooke awaye from him all comforte, to the end we ſhould not diſpaire if the lord ſomtimes withdrawe his comforte from vs in temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſeme to be a ſlepe.

Alſo the vayne and hipocritical opinion of the Stoikes is here confuted which make their wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be with out griefe.

Let it not therefore be greuous to vs if we bee forſaken of all men, yea and of our moſt dereſt frends. This is not one dayes worke, but it requyreth a longe and continual fight, if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil ouercome him ſelfe and cleaue only to God.

We muſt therefore according to the example of Chriſte ſtande ſtedfaſte in afflictions, neyther muſte we come downe from the croſſe, how ſo euer our enemyes rage or bee woode agaynſte vs. We ſhall ſee ſtreyght waye God will ayde vs from aboue.

            <q>☞And when the euen was come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the preparation of the paſſeouer, which went before the Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>baoth, there came a rich man of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathea, named Ioſeph a counceller and an honeſte ſenator, a good man and a iuſt, he did not conſente to the counſell and deede of them, whiche alſo hymſelfe wayted for the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and therwithall was a diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecretlye for feare of the Iewes, he taking bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes went vnto Pilate and aſked the body of Ieſus.

Then toke they the body of Ieſus, &amp; wrap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ped it in lynnen cloth wyth the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as the manner is of the Iewes to bury. And there was in the place where he was crucifyed a gardeyn, and in the gardeyn a new ſepulchre, wherein was neuer man yet layde. Then Ioſeph put the body of Ieſus in hys new tombe, which he had he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen oute in a ſtone, there therefore layd they Ieſus, becauſe the Iewes preparation day, for the tombe was nere.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:6975:74"/> So alſo are we iuſte if we receaue Chriſte by fayth whom they wayted for, and if we keepe our ſelues vnſpotted from thys worlde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For Chriſt is our righteouſneſſe: That man ſetteth forth an example both of greate conſtancie and alſo of fayth. For in how great a daunger doth he put him ſelfe, when as he conſenteth not or els withſtandeth the enterpriſes of the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? Who ſeeth it not to be a preſent daunger for any man to aſke the bodye of Ieſus in ſo great hatred, and crueltie, and to burye it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably? But fayth if it be a true fayth, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempteth great and perillous thinges with an inuincible courage. When as then the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſte ſaith that he was a noble and riche ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we muſte not regard that onely in him, but the Euangeliſt ſetteth forth hys couragious mind and great fayth.

Let vs thinke the ſame of Nicodemus, &amp; haue a regard not of what power and riches he was, but of how great fayth, and boldenes of minde. Let vs marke with how great an argumente they beare witnes of their fayth which do put themſelues forth to the diſpleaſure of all men and to the daunger of lyfe for Chriſtes ſake.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:6975:74"/> If they had followed him in his lyfe time, they had not vttered ſo greate fayth, as when they cleaue vnto him being vilelie reproched &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: neyther are they aſhamed to honoure hym very noblye whom all men deteſted as a wicked one. They therefore whiche before hyd the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues and diſſembled the matter for feare, come now forth with glorye, to the example of al the faythful.

To waite for the kingdome of heauen is a Periphraſis of the faythful: He loked for the kingdome of god, that is he was a faythfull man he beleued. And ſurely his faith was no ſmal faith, which durſt thinges being yet freſhe in the middeſt of the rage of the furious and malicious me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, aſke the body of Chriſt.

So far is he from caſting vs a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>way for our weakenes, that he alſo appeareth vnto womenne, and maketh them Apoſtles of his reſurrection. For they came of loue to the ſepulchre, partly to ſee the Sepulchre, partly to annoynte the bodye of Ieſus. The earth was moued at the death of Chryſt, to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clare that it was heauy with his creator: And it is in like caſe moued at the reſurrection, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring gladlye to reſtore hym whome it had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, and as it were reioyſinge that Chriſte was riſen agayne. Moreouer the earthe was moued at the ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the holy Ghoſt, to teach vs by this figure, that by the death and reſur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rection of Chriſte thorough vertue of the holy Ghoſt the whole world ſhoulde not only be mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued but alſo be renewed: we learne further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more that the councels of the vngodly agaynſt the truth are vayne, for howe ſoeuer they go aboute by lyes to extinguiſhe the truth, yet doth God bryng to paſſe, that by thoſe things which they haue excerciſed to oppres the truth the truth ſhall more brightly ſhyne forth: wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thely therfore are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes repudiated &amp; blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which do abhor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, ſo that they which could not abide to be ſaued by the truth, ſhould peariſh beyng wrapped in lyes &amp; errors. This goſpell is chieflye declared vnto Peter, who was in moſt great he uynes, aſwel for the deth of his lorde whome he offended by denyenge of hym, as alſo for hys deniall, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue comfort and knowe that his ſynne was forgeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:6975:79"/> that we beyng dead to ſins mighte henſeforth liue to righteouſnes. They which doe ſtill lye and rotte in the filthyneſſe of ſinnes do declare that they haue not yet riſen again with Chriſt. For they which are riſen truly in Chriſte, doe ſhew forth the ſame in worthy fruites, neither doth ſinne reigne in their mortall bodye. They thincke not vpon earthlye thinges, but their minde is vpon heuenlye thinges aboue, where Chriſte their hed ſytteth at the righte hande of the Father.</q>
            <p>☞And they went out quickly and fled from the Sepulchre, for they trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and were amaſed, neither ſayd they any thing to any man, for they were afraid: And Mary Magdalene ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other diſciple whome Ieſus loued, and ſaide vnto them. They haue taken awaye my Lorde out of the graue, and we can not tell where they haue laied him. Peter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> went forth and that other diſciple &amp; came to the ſepulchre: And they ran both together, &amp; the other diſciple did out runne Peter, and came firſt to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pulchre.

For as yet they knew not the ſcripture that he ſhuld riſe again from the deade. Then the diſciples went away again to theyr own howſes.<note place="margin">Epanodus</note> But Mary ſtode with out at the Sepulchre weping. And as ſhe was wepi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, ſhe bowed her ſelf into the ſepulchre, &amp; ſaw two au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gels clothed in white, ſittinge the one at the heade and the other at the feete there where they hadde layed the body of Ieſus. They ſayd vnto her woman why wepeſt thou? She ſayd vnto them. They haue taken awaye my Lord, neither wot I where they haue layde him: When ſhe had thus ſayd, ſhe tourned her backe, and ſaw Ieſus ſtanding, and knew not that it was Ieſus: Ieſus ſayd vnto her, woman why wepeſt thou? Whome ſeakeſt thou? She ſuppoſing hym to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:6975:80"/> be a gardener, ſayed vnto him. Syr if thou haſte borne him henſe, tel me where thou haſte layed him, and I will fetch hym. Ieſus ſayd vnto her, Marye, Shee tourned her ſelfe and ſayed vnto hym. <hi>Rabboni,</hi> which is to ſaye, Maiſter. Ieſus ſayd vnto her, touch me not, for I am not yet aſcen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded vnto my Father, but goe to my brotherne, and ſay vnto them, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cende vnto my Father and to youre Father, to my God and to youre God. Marye Magdalene came and tolde the diſciples, that ſhe had ſene the Lord, &amp; had ſpoken ſuch things vnto her: Shee tolde, I ſaye, them which were with him as thei mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; wept. And they although they hearde that he was on liue and that ſhe had ſene him, beleued not.</p>
            <q>THe Euangeliſtes do by many &amp; diuers wordes beate into our heddes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſte, that we myghte ſee that Chriſte was exalted after death, and beleue that we ſhall enter into lyfe by the death of Chryſt, and that alſo our fayth and hope myght be confirmed. Chriſt could in dede haue illuſtrated the harts of his diſciples w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his ſprite as ſone as he was dead, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:6975:80"/> ſhould haue nothing douted of his reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but he loueth this doubt &amp; weaknes in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to make them ſo much the more earneſt in their ſupplications vnto God. The more a ſick man fealeth his woundes and diſeaſes, the more is he made deſirus of medicine. So lykewiſe the more we fele in our ſelues the weaknes of the fleſh, the more do we run vnto God for ayde &amp; the leſſe do we bragge in our owne ſtrengthe, which can doe nothing without god: when as therfore we feele oure fayth begin to fall, then haue we occaſion offred vs to call vpon God wyth continuall prayers. The prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of God doth by litle and litle leade the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to the knowlege of the reſurrection of his ſonne till it hath fullye made them perfect. Thei ſaw the ſtone rowled a wai, thei fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the ſepulchre empty, thep ſawe the napkins &amp; the lynnen clothes layed aparte, the place wherin he laye, and finally the aungell teſtifyinge that he was truly riſen. And this is diligently to be marked, that the Angell ſayth that Chriſte of Nazareth whiche was crucified is not there, by which wordes theyr opinion is plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Chriſt eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry wher after his reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; not in a place. For what other thing do they, then deny the verity of the humayne nature in Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uoke from hel Marcyons opinion. Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy was not in the ſepulchre after his reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when as it appeared vnto Marye Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene, neyther was it wyth the eleuen at
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:6975:81"/> Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when as it was with the two which went toward Emaus. No more can it be in the breade, when as according to the ſcriptures it was taken vp to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſetteth at the right hand of God the father. For Chriſt went from the father and came into the worlde, againe he left the world and went to the father. But he left not the worlde, in reſpecte that he is God, when as he is with vs to the end of the world: therfore left he the worlde as concerninge his manhed, that is, he caried into heauen the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which he toke of the virgin Mary into the glorye of the father. This is the foundation of the Catholike and Chriſtian faythe, and the hope of all the elect, which whileſt they denye or ſtirre, let them take heede, what they make of Chryſte, or howe they are to be counted for Chriſtians. Let them take heede I ſaye what foundation they ſtick vnto. The fleſh of Chriſt alſo is glorified after his reſurrection, and yet for all that is it fleſh in deede, and putteth not of the nature of fleſh, and although it be ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>all, yet is it not conuerted into a ſpirite, and much leſſe into God. A ſpyrite (ſayth Chriſte) hath neyther fleſh nor bone as ye ſee me haue: The body therfore of Chriſt is in heauen, and not in the bread of the ſupper which coulde be neyther neceſſarye nor profitable: yea it was caried vp is heauen after the reſurrection in the ſight of the Apoſtles, which was ſo expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for theyr fayth, which fayth they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer eſtablyſh by the ſuppenor by the preſence
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:6975:81"/> of his body glorified, but that thei alwaies wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and doubted til ſuche time as they were confyrmed by the holy ghoſt. We muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tranſferre our minde from all corporal and viſible thing into heauen, where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of god, &amp; beleue that Chriſte hath geuen his body to the death for vs. After this ſorte is the body of Chriſt eaten, not with the teeth of the body, but by the contemplacion of fayth. For fayth in dede, which cleaueth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God may vſe corporall things, but not as though ſaluation were bounde to thoſe things, and be deliuered to vs thorough them, but to put in practiſe fayth and charitie. Euen ſo we cary about the bread and wine in the Supper, we diſtribute it amongeſt vs and we eate not to merite any thing of God by the ſame as it were by a certayn worſhipping, but bycauſe by theſe outward ſignes our ſenſes are ſtirred vp, to weigh &amp; conſider more diligentlye the grace of God geuen vs by the death of Chriſt and to lift vp our mindes to Chriſte the bread of lyfe, which for our ſakes deſcended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen. For our weakeneſſe therefore are the ſacramentes inſtituted of Chriſt, as it were certayne ſignes of the grace and beneuolence of God towardes vs, which do ſtirre vs vp to conſider the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, wherein our fayth is exerciſed. For they whiche vſe theſe ſignes doe teſtifye that they haue fayth in the promiſes of God, and that they bee of the number of thoſe which acknowledge God for theyr God, whom they
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:6975:82"/> worſhip in ſpirite, in whom they truſt to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they geue thanks, &amp;c. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth god more declare &amp; ſhewe him ſelfe to be our God &amp; moſt louing Father, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when he promiſeth to geue vs hys ſonne and alſo performeth it?<note place="margin">Roma. viii.</note> For how can he not geue vs all thinges with hys ſonne? Or what can he denye whiche hath geuen vs his only begotten Sonne?<note place="margin">Iohn. iii.</note> And he hath geuen him vnto vs, not to puniſhe and condemne vs, as we iuſtly haue deſerued, but that by him we might be ſaued and haue euerlaſting lyfe. For he gaue him to be ours al whole, to be our righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, wiſedome, hollyneſſe, redemption, ſaluation and life. What a great loue is thys, what a great grace, the eternal Sonne of God deſcendeth and taketh vpon hym ſelfe our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: that we being made newe by his grace, might aſcend, taking after a ſort the diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He deſcended that we creping on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d might be thoroughe him tranſferred and lift vp to his glory. The Lord of al things taketh vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the ſhape of a ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to make vs which are by nature ſeruaunts, &amp; oppreſſed with moſt greuous bondage, the ſonnes of God. He ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ſelfe our weakenes to ſtrengthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs with his ſpirite. He is made man to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme vs by his grace in a manner into Gods. He hath communicated with vs in fleſhe and bloude being made partaker of the ſame, that alſo the children, namely we, might haue euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fellowſhip with him. In fine, he would be made like to hys brethren in al thyngs,<note place="margin">Hebr. 3.</note> that
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:6975:82"/> we myghte ſee that we haue a mercifull and faythfull high prieſte to doe all thoſe thinges which we haue to do with God, which maketh ſatiſfaction by his bloude for all our ſinnes. He hath taken vpon hym ſelfe all that is ours, to participate vnto vs what ſo euer he him ſelfe is and hath. And thys is it which he ſayeth to Magdalene, I aſcende to my Father and your father, my God and your God. See what a loue the father hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, both to be named and to be the Sonnes of God.<note place="margin">i.

For his ſpirite bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth witnes to our ſpirit that we are the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes of God. For we haue not receaued a ſpirite of bondage to be affeard,<note place="margin">Roma. viii.</note> but the ſpirite of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the which we crye <hi>Abba</hi> Father. God therefore is our Father and our God, and we are hys children, with whom he hath made a new couenaunte, and confyrmed it by the bloud of hys Sonne, that we might nowe haue fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip &amp; mutuall perticipacion with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; hys ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne Ieſus Chriſt.

            <q>THe ſame daye, namely in the which the Lord had riſen,<note place="margin">Luke. 10.</note> two of theſe ſeuenty diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples whom the Lorde whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing had choſen, wente forth: It appeareth that theſe diſciples woulde haue fled for feare, namelye of the perſecution, which they ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be at hande. This hiſtorye alſo teacheth that it was true which Chriſt promiſed, name<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly that he would be preſente euen there where as but twoe were gathered togethers in his name. God is alwayes preſent with his, yea &amp; then when they think leaſt, he putteth them in memorye of him ſelfe, telleth them what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel is beſt to take, &amp; manifeſteth him ſelfe vnto them. More ouer he ſpeaketh outwardlye by his word, by his ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and finally by all his creatures, to ſtirre vp and prouoke vs to praiſe him. God therfore is alwayſe and euery where preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with vs an arbiter &amp; a beholder not onely of all our woorkes, but alſo of our thoughtes. This teacheth vs to liue honeſtly with feare and great reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce before him. For if we be aſhamed to commite vile thinges whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men behold vs, how much more ought we to be aſhamed to committe any ſuch thing in Gods
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:6975:86"/> ſyghte? The preſence therefore of god doeth euerye where admoniſhe vs to abſtaine from ſinnes: we hoped (ſaye they) that it had beene he whiche ſhoulde haue redemed Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell. By theſe wordes maye be gathered, that there was then a ſolempne and famous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyon amonge the Iewes, as touchynge Meſſias the king, which ſhould redeame them and renewe theyr kingdome. For ſuch a one had they promiſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, eueri where both in the law &amp; the prophetes: But they applied al that to acertein te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral kingdome &amp; carnall ſetting at liberty: although our Iewes nowe a dayes deny that there was a Meſſias promiſed, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as neuer theleſſe the Scribes aunſweared the wyſe menne whyche ſoughte Chriſte, that he ſhoulde be borne in Bethelem, and that by the prophecy of Michea. Their fayth is weake &amp; feable, but not altogether extinguiſhed, they talked of Ieſus, they deſyred hym feruentlye. Chriſt therfore ioyneth hym ſelfe with them, &amp; fyrſt diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bleth, neyther openeth he hym ſelfe by &amp; by vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fes with their owne mouth their weakenes: And then at the laſt he declareth vnto them the ſcriptures, and nouriſheth and kindleth that little ſparke of fyre which was ſo depely hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in them, which they alſo themſelues confeſſe, ſayinge, did not our hartes burne within vs while he talked with vs. The word muſt be added vnto thoſe which are yet in doubte of their faythe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge to the example of Chriſte, by the whych
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:6975:86"/> worde fayth is encreaſed like as fire is when wod is put vnto it. But there muſte firſte be a fayth, thoughe it be neuer ſo ſmall, otherwiſe it is done in vaine, to put wod to the fire, that is, it is to no purpoſe to preache the worde of God to an infidele. And whereas the faythful do willingly heare the worde of God, it can not be choſen, but that the mynde ſhalbe illuſtrate and kindled by the ſpirite of God.</q>
            <p>☞And he ſayed vnto them O fooles &amp; ſlowe of harte to beleue all that the prophets haue ſpoken: Oughte not Chriſt to haue ſuffered theſe things, and to enter into his glory? And he began at Moyſes and all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prophetes &amp; enterpreted vnto them in al the ſcriptures which wer writ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten of him, and they drew nye vnto the caſtle which thei went vnto, and he made as thoughe he would haue gone farther. And they conſtrayned hym ſayinge, abyde wyth vs for it draweth toward nyght, and the day is farre ſpent. And he went in to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye with them. And it came to paſſe as he ſat wyth them, he tooke bread and bleſſed, &amp; brake &amp; gaue to them:
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:6975:87"/> and their eyes wer opened, and they knewe him, and he vaniſhed out of their ſighte. And they ſaide betwene them ſelues, did not our harts burn within vs, while he talked wyth vs by the way and opened vnto vs the ſcriptures? and thei roſe vp the ſame howre, &amp; returned back again to Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ruſalem, and found the eleuen gathe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red to gether, and them that were with them, which ſaid The Lord is riſen in deede and hath appeared to Symon: And they tolde what thinges were done in the way, and how he was knowen by the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the bread.</p>
            <q>CHriſte nouriſheth their faith, althogh it be but weake, but firſt he rebuketh them, to make them more attentiue: He ſhaketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye the drowſines and forgetfulneſſe, of the fleſhe, that they mighte geue attentiue hede to thoſe things which the ſcriptures witneſſe of him and draweth forth the ſpirite which ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the ſriptures. But the places which Chriſte broughte out of the lawe and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, are not here lefte oute withoute the prouidence of God (although they be here and there mencioned afterwarde by the Apoſtles)
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:6975:87"/> to make vs more diligently to ſearch the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we heare, that the ſcriptures beare witnes of Chriſt. For ſo ſayth Iohn in the v. Chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Search the ſcripturs, for in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you think ye haue eternall life, and they are they whiche teſtifye of me. Yf ye had beleued Moyſes, ye woulde haue beleued me alſo, for he wrote of me. He therefore which will confyrme the weake ones in faythe, and comforte them whiche be heauye and faynte harted muſte bringe the holye ſcriptures, for the woorde of God is the meate &amp; lyfe of the ſoule. And the ſriptures doe teſtifye two thinges of Chriſte, fyrſt how he was humbled, &amp; throwne downe for vs and what he alſo ſuffered for our ſakes: Secondlye what greate glory he was exalted vnto after his paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that we might alſo learn &amp;. ſtedfaſtly beleue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſte ſuffered for vs to make ſatiſfaction for our ſinnes. And then that he roſe again for our iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that we might beleue Chriſt to be our righteouſnes, and that our life is reſtored vnto vs by Chriſte, when as we hope we ſhal ariſe again to eternal life. But we muſt take hede in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time which waye we may come to this life, namely by the croſſe and denial of our ſelfe. For it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for vs to go by any other way to the inheri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taunce of the heauenlye glorye, then that waye which the onely begotten ſonne of God wente. And it behoued Chriſte to ſuffer and ſo for to enter into his glory: he that doth not diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weigh this, is a foole &amp; ſlow of harte, and let him deſire of god to open his mynd in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:6975:88"/> ſcriptures: This is alſo to be noted, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and forgeuenes muſt be preached one<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly in the name of Chriſt: but he meaneth by re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pentaunce and forgeuenes of ſins the Goſpell. For the partes of the goſpell are repentance &amp; forgeuenes of ſinnes. For ſaluation gotten by Chriſt hath many names, and ſometimes it is called but by one of the names, and that by the figure where one part is put for the whole,<note place="margin">Synechdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> as maye appeare by the actes of the Apoſtles. He whych doth not acknowledge him ſelfe to be a ſynner, can not be able to receaue forgeue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, neyther can he be deſyrous of ſaluation by Chriſt. But he which feeleth and aknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his diſeaſe, he I ſay runneth gredelye to Chriſt the Phiſition of the ſoules, &amp; there doth vncouer and laye forth his diſeaſe.

(For he appeared vnto the eleuen as they ſatte at meate, &amp; caſt in their teeth their vnbelief, and hardnes of harte, becauſe they bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not them whyche had ſeene that he was riſen agayn) And they offred him a pyece of broyled fyſhe, and a piece of an honye combe, &amp; he tooke it, and did eate it in theyr ſyghtes.</p>
            <q>WE ſee againe how Chriſt according to his promyſe is preſent with his which are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled &amp; gathered together in hys name

He eateth not to refreſh his body, and he vſeth not this corporall meate for neceſſitye, but to declare vnto his the veritie of humayn nature in him: He eateth not therfore for him ſelfe but for his Apoſtles.

Iohn the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:6975:90"/> Euangeliſte teſtifieth that the dores wer ſhut and that Ieſus entred in when the dores wer ſhut: Neyther for al thys doth this abſurditie and impoſſibilitie follow, which ſome do gather by this place, namely that the bodye of Chriſte did penetrate the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the woode, or was together with the woode in one and the ſelfe place, For the glorified bodye can by no other reaſon entre. The Sonne entreth through the glaſſe, and a voyce thorough a dore, and yet it followeth not that two bodyes are both in one place. This is not done raſhely and withoute Gods prouidence, namely that Thomas who was very hard of beliefe was not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the reaſt of the Apoſtles when he appeared, and that he obſtinately gaineſayth his fellowes which told him they had ſene the Lorde. For Chriſt vſed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> incredulitie of Thomas to ſupport our faith withal, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> veritie of his reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might the more manifeſtly be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And the weake fayth of Thomas beareth ſtronger witnes of hys reſurrection, then doth the eaſye &amp; quicke beliefe of Magdalene. So the Lorde knoweth how to vſe our naughtineſſe to hys glorye and our ſaluation. Fayth is the gifte of God &amp; no man can beleue, except it be geuen him of god. Here may therfore be gathered three ſortes of men out of this preſent hiſtorie: Iudas, Peter and Thomas. Iudas is a treacherer and a runnegate, which betrayeth an innocente. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter denyeth and ſweareth. Thomas doubteth and obſtinately gayneſayeth. Here we learne
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:6975:90"/> firſte that there is a greate difference and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne degrees in ſinnes. No man ſurely liueth without fault, &amp; all we are ſinners, but one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth more heynouſly then an other.

For if the doctrine of Chriſt had bene but a guyle, then Iudas would neuer haue repented him of his betraying, he woulde nothing haue bene aſhamed to haue returned to the reaſte of the Apoſtles, he had nothing neded to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored the money and to ſaye, I haue ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Innocente bloude.

This I ſpeake bycauſe of thoſe which wreſte the words of Chriſt to the ſacrament of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupper, &amp; will proue by theſe words y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theyr fayth is better whiche beleue that the bodye of Chriſt is in the bread, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theirs is which ſaye that the bread is but a ſigne of the body. They marke not that Chriſt ſpeaketh not here of the holy ſupper, but to fortifie the faith of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rettion. He that beleueth that Chriſt was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified &amp; that he alſo aroſe againe, this man is bleſſed, although he ſee it not with his corporal eyes as Thomas dyd. Otherwiſe there ſhould be two wayes to ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. One to beleue that Chriſt ſuffred for vs &amp; roſe agayne, &amp; an other to beleue that the body of Chriſt is in the bread But there is none whiche vnderſtandeth not how great an abſurditie this is &amp; not agreable to fayth. Here is alſo to be noted that in theſe wordes, bicauſe y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> haſt ſene me thou alſo bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt, this word beleue is here take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not propre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but improprely.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> For that which a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeeth, the ſame he beleueth not. For Paule ſaith that fayth is the ſubſtance &amp; certeinty of an inuiſible
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:6975:92"/> thing. Fayth therefore is here take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, &amp; to beleue, For to try. And many other ſignes did Ieſus, &amp;c. As though Iohn would ſaye, I haue diligently ſet forth and writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the actes of Chriſt, although not al: for who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do that? Neuertheleſſe thoſe thinges whiche are writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are ſufficient for oure ſaluation, namely ſuch thinges as pertaine to the Godhed &amp; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine nature of Chriſt, to his doctrine &amp; mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, &amp; finally what ſo euer pertayneth to the true fayth, whereby we are ſaued, and alſo to obtaine euerlaſting life. He which beleueth not theſe things which are left, neither woulde he beleue other things if they ſhoulde be written. Theſe things therfore ſuffice the beleuers nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeke they for any more thinges. For the which cauſe ſuche thinges as the Euangeliſte teſtifieth to be writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt bee red and marked of vs with greate reuerence &amp; earneſt ſtudye: Let vs daye &amp; night be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt in theſe things &amp; meditating of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that our fayth may be ſupported, that our hope may be eſtabliſhed, charitie may be kindled, pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce exerciſed obedience, modeſtie, &amp; all other good ſpirituall giftes aduaunced. But they be fooles yea and vngodly, whiche go aboute to proue by theſe wordes, that it is lawful for theſe Popes to deuiſe and imagen certayne other thynges of their owne heade, to fill vp the place of ſuch thinges as are here lefte oute. For Iohn the Euaungeliſte hath in briefe comprehended the whole ſome of Chriſtian Religion, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye that Chriſte is the true Sonne of GOD
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:6975:93"/> which for our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and was dead and roſe agayne, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red for vs eternall life: what can they adde to theſe thynges?</q>
            <p>¶Afterward did Ieſus ſhewe him ſelfe againe at the ſea of Tiberias, and on this wiſe ſhewed he him felfe. There were together Simo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Peter, &amp; Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas whiche is called Didimus and Nathanaell of Cana in Galile, and the ſonnes of Zebedei &amp; two others of hys Diſciples. Simon Peter ſayd vnto them, I goe on fiſhyng: They ſayd vnto him, we will alſo go with thee. They went forth &amp; entred im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly into a ſhip, and that nyght they caught nothing. But when the morning was nowe come, Ieſus ſtoode on the ſhore, neuertheleſſe the Diſciples knew not that it was Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Ieſus ſayd vnto them, Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue ye any meate? Thei aunſwered him, no. And he ſayd vnto them, caſt out the nette on the right ſide of the ſhip and ye ſhal finde. They caſt out therfore, and anon they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to drawe it for the multitude of fiſhes. Then ſayd that Diſciple who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:6975:93"/> Ieſus loued vnto Peter, It is the Lorde? When Symon Peter heard y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was the lord, he girded his coate vnto him, for he was naked, &amp; ſpra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea. The other diſciples came by ſhip, for they wer not far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but as it wer two hundred cubites, and they drew the net with fiſhes. Aſſone then as they were come to land, they ſaw hote coales and fyſhe layd theron, and breade: Ieſus ſayde vnto them, bring of the fiſhes which ye haue now caughte. Simon Peter went vp and drewe the net to lande ful of great fyſhes an hundred fiftye and three: And for all there were ſo many, yet brake not the net. Ieſus ſayd vnto them, come and dine. And none of the diſciples durſt aſke hym to ſay, who art thou? For they knew that it was the lord. Ieſus the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came and tooke the bread and gaue them, and fyſhe lykewyſe. Thys is nowe the thyrde tyme that Ieſus ſhewed hym ſelfe to his dyſciples, after that he was riſen agayn from the deade.</p>
            <q>THe nyer the Lord draweth to his aſcention, the more he prepareth the mindes of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:6975:94"/> to the office which they ſhould haue to doe, eſtabliſhing firſt the thee certeinty of hys reſurrection: he had called the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him before from fiſhing, that they mighte alſo catche men by the preaching of the word: He putteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe in remembraunce of thinges doone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ſtirreth them vp by a newe myracle, to remembre to what an office they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted, and what fruite they ſhoulde bringe therby, and that not by their owne power, but by the powre of God: For they had taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge before Chriſte appeared vnto them. All our labour is in vaine, where as the operation of the holy Ghoſt and powre of Gods word is not annexed: And what ſoeuer we ſhall take, what fruicte ſo euer ſhall come of our prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>achinge, that all whole oughte to be aſcribed to the benefite of the Lorde: Let vs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the Lorde was with vs and gaue the ſucces. Let vs bring ſiſh, that is men being caught by the net of the Goſpel, out of the tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peſteous ſea, &amp; that not to our ſelues but vnto the Lord. In the meane time is ſhadowed the multitude of the gentiles which ſhould be dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen vnto Chriſt by the Apoſtles: And this is a very trim ſimilitude of the net to the church, as Chriſt teacheth in the xiii. of Mathew.</q>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g>Then when they had dynied, Ieſus ſayed vnto Symon Peter, Simon loueſte thou mee more then theſe?
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:6975:94"/> He ſayed vnto him, yea Lorde, thou knoweſt that I loue thee, he ſayed vnto him, fede my lambes: And he ſayed vnto him agayn, Simon Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anna, Loueſt thou me? He ſayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: Yea Lord thou knowſt that I loue thee: He ſayd vnto him: Fede my ſhepe: And he ſayd vnto him the thyrd time. Symon Ioanna, loueſt thou me?

Thou knoweſt all thinges, thou knoweſt that I loue thee: Ieſus ſayed vnto him, fede my ſhepe.</p>
            <q>HEre is opened in Peter the boſom of gods mercy to ſinners, who when he had fallen heynouſely, is for al that fullye reſtored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by the Lord, ſo far is Chriſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reiectyng of him, that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteh him to fede his lambs Let no man therefore diſpayre but gette him to Chriſte the pledge of grace: A treble confeſſion is oppoſed to a treble deniall. And therwithal is preſcribed in a figure a certaine ordre for the paſtors of the Churche of Chriſte, which they muſt followe, namely for the loue of Chriſte to fede his ſhepe.

            <q>THat which is ſpoken by chriſt to Peter, let vs thinke the ſame to be ſpoken vnto vs al,

But where ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt be more commodiouſly prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, then in thoſe places where the multitude of people accuſtome to aſſemble together. This certaynely dyd the Apoſtles, eyther on the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dayes or elles on the Sabboth dayes when the people were aſſembled together, both to be there preſent them ſelues, and alſo to bryng the Iewes which claue vnto their old ſuperſticio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to Chriſt, which might be done moſte commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly in the temple whether the people of the Iewes reſorted. Neyther dyd they ſo ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnly and diſdaynefully ſeperate them ſelues from the Phariſees and the reſte of the Iewes as the Anabaptiſtes nowe of dayes accuſtome to ſeperate themſelues from thoſe which do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue and cleaue vnto Chriſt. That the ſoules of the Godly are receaued into Ioyes, and the ſoules of the vngodlye are pulled to punyſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, not only the holy Scriptures do teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie but alſo the writers of the Gentilles. And the Philoſophers and Poets doe manifeſtlye agree with the Prophetes in theſe thynges al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſpeake it with other words. Here of come the fieldes of Eliſius, and the ſorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

Wherfore when it is ſeperated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bodye it retourneth vnto God, euen as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges returne vnto the fountayne from whence they came, all thinges flowe agayne to theyr author. Theſe thinges are ſo in dede and ſo are written. And Chriſte truly teſtifieth in him ſelfe that the ſoule liueth after the death of the body, and that men retourne to their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. which thyng was neuer before that time ſet before the eyes of men, although as many as were of ſounde iudgemente vnderſtoode it. Chriſte proueth the lyfe of hys ſoule by hys Reſurrection &amp; Aſcencion and that glory ſhal come to the whole man with God. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore teacheth not only by worde, but alſo decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in deede what ſhall be come of the Godlye after this lyfe. He aſcended vp into heauen, to prepare the waye to glorye for vs, I we ſhould knowe, whether we ſhall goe after death, and what ſo euer our mindes fele and beleue, al the ſame do we ſee to haue gon before in our head Chriſt. Chriſt deſcended once for our ſaluation ſake, agayne he aſcended once, that we ſhoulde not hence forth requyre the corporall preſence of Chriſt, but our hartes being lifted vpwarde we ſhoulde meditate the heauenly lyfe with Chriſt oure King. Put caſe there were a king whiche woulde ſeeke for the common profite, woulde doe Iuſtice, and make equall and good lawes, and graunt that he were a father of the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:6975:107"/> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, &amp;c. It cannot well come to paſſe that euery one in hys kingdome can ſee hym, for ſome dwell farre from hym, ſome are blynd or lame ſo that they can not come vnto him, there are but fewe which haue the libertie to bee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly conuerſaunte with him, and yet in the meane time al of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> though they dwel neuer ſo farre of haue the fruition of the common peace and tranquilitie, which he hath gotten and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth by his wyſedome, euen as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Euen after the ſame ſorte is it with our king Chriſt, it is not geuen to al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſee him corporally, which happened to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles by a ſingulare prerogatiue, yet may all the godly by faith haue the fruition of the grace and redemption gotten by him, yea euen thoſe whiche neuer ſaw thym with theyr corporall eyes: and for this cauſe dyd Chriſte when he ſhoulde departe from his Diſciples as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his had promiſe vnto them an other com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forter and aduocate namely the holy ghoſte, whiche ſhoulde teache them the ſpirituall and true knowledge of Chriſt.
